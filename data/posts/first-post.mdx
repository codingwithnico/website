Yo! Finally starting my blog. Been wanting to do this for a while, but kept putting it off lol. Took a couple of hours to setup
everything up with `Next.js` and `MDX`. The main goal for setting up this up i guess is to get better at writing and document what i'm learning/doing.

## Why Next.js & MDX

Well first off, this whole website is built in Next.js, and with the new `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` functions, it didn't really make sense
to use something else (eg. Gatsby). In case you're wondering, those new functions allow you to fetch data at build time and pre-render pages based on the data,
which is pretty cool. &#128064;

So what is MDX? In case you haven't heard about it, MDX stands for `Markdown and JSX`. What's really cool about it is that you can use JSX (eg. React components)
inside of your Markdown documents, which allows for much more dynamic content.

`Example of using React component in MDX:`

I had built a blog before using `Gatsby` (where I also used MDX), so I
kinda knew this was the direction I wanted to take. Next up will be to work on the styling a bit.

Anyways, thanks for reading and if you're interested, the next blog post will on how I set everything up.
