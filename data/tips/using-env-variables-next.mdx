# Using environment variables in development with Next.js

To use environment variables in development, you first need to create an `.env.local` file. Secondly, by default,
all environment variables loading through `.env.local` are only available in the Node.js environment. This means that if your variable
is going to be accessed on the client-side/browser, it's needs to be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.

Here's an example:

```jsx
.env.local

// Variable accessed on server-side/API
const SOME_SECRET = sdfgjsdf9324324324

// Variable access on client-side
const NEXT_PUBLIC_SOME_PRIVATE_KEY=3458425nsfd
```

<Spacer height={10} />

```jsx
someClientSideFile.jsx

// Here's how you access the variable on frontend
const myPrivateKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SOME_PRIVATE_KEY
```
